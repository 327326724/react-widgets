react-widgets
=============

A set of the basic ui widgets built from scratch with React, based on the excellent Kendo UI Core and jQuery UI.

- DropdownList
- ComboBox
- Select (multi select)
- DateTimePicker
- Calendar 
- NumberPicker 

### Install

`npm install react-widgets`

### Docs

you can find docs [here](http://theporchrat.github.io/react-widgets/docs/)
Docs are a simple React app, you can build with gulp `gulp docs`

### Old Browser Support

The goal is to support IE8+, but currently it is difficult for me to test a wide variety of browsers so there is no guarantee 
it will work (patches welcome!).

One aspect that is definately true is that animation is not supported for browsers that do not support CSS Transitions.
